## Download Terraform Configurations

Two Terraform configurations, *pre-cluster* and *post-cluster*, are provided in the *tf* folder of the downloadable [starter-kit](https://github.com/larkintuckerllc/starter-kit/releases/tag/0.2.1) GitHub repository.

## Update Terraform Pre-Cluster Configuration's Constants

1. Copy the file *tf/pre-cluster/terraform.tfvars.sample* to *tf/pre-cluster/terraform.tfvars*

2. Edit the file *tf/pre-cluster/terraform.tfvars*

3. Update the value of the *AVAILABILITY_ZONES* variable with the availability zone names, e.g., *us-east-1a* and *us-east-1b*

4. Update the value of the *IDENTIFIER* variable with a regionally unique (in the account) name for the infrastructure. The name must be a valid hostname format; [hostname(7) â€” Linux manual page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/hostname.7.html). For example, *starter-kit*

5. Update the value of the *REGION* variable with the region name, e.g., *us-east-1*

6. Save the file

**note**: Unlike the Terraform configurations' variables below, once the infrastructure is created the values of constants cannot be changed once the infrastructure is created.

## Update Terraform Post-Cluster Configuration's Constants

1. Copy the file *tf/post-cluster/terraform.tfvars.sample* to *tf/post-cluster/terraform.tfvars*

2. Edit the file *post-cluster/terraform.tfvars*

3. Update the value of the *IDENTIFIER* variable; matching value in *tf/pre-cluster/terraform.tfvars*

4. Update the value of the *REGION* variable; matching value in *tf/pre-cluster/terraform.tfvars*

5. Save the file

## Update Terraform Post-Cluster Configurations' Variables

1. Edit the file *tf/post-cluster/terraform.tfvars*

2. Update the value of the *certificate_arn* variable with the public wild card certificate ARN (from prerequisites); for example *arn:aws:acm:[obmitted]:[obmitted]:certificate/[obmitted]*

3. Update the value of the *zone_name* variable with the domain name associated with the host zone (from prerequisites); for example, *example.com*

4. Save the file

**note**: We will later update the other configuration's variables.

## Create Pre-Cluster Infrastructure

1. From the command-line in the *tf/pre-cluster* folder, execute `terraform init`

2. From the command-line in the *tf/pre-cluster* folder, execute `terraform apply`

## Access Kubernetes Cluster

1. From the commmand-line, execute `aws eks update-kubeconfig --region [replace] --name [replace]`; replace with region, e.g., *us-east-1*, and identifier, e.g., *starter-kit*

2. From the command-line, execute `kubectl get nodes` to confirm access to Kubernetes Cluster

## Authenticate Kubernetes Provider

1. From the command-line, execute `kubectl config current-context`; copy output

2. Edit the file *tf/post-cluster/main.tf*

3. Uncomment the *kubernetes* provider block labeled with *FOR IMPORT ONLY*

4. Comment the *kubernetes* provider block with no comments

5. Update the value of *config-context* in the *kubernetes* provider block

6. Save the file

## Initialize Post-Cluster Configuration

1. From the command-line in the *tf/post-cluster* folder, execute `terraform init`

## Import AWS Auth ConfigMap

1. From the command-line in the *tf/post-cluster* folder, execute `terraform import module.cd.kubernetes_config_map.this kube-system/aws-auth`

## Re-Authenticate Kubernetes Provider

1. Edit the file *tf/post-cluster/main.tf*

2. Comment the *kubernetes* provider block labeled with *FOR IMPORT ONLY*

3. Uncomment the *kubernetes* provider with no comments

**note**: The Terraform *import* command does not support variables in provider blocks

## Create Post-Cluster Infrastructure

1. From the command-line in the *tf/post-cluster* folder, execute `terraform apply`

## Create a Sample Workload

1. Edit the file *tf/post-cluster/terraform.tfvars*

2. Replace the *workload* variable with a sample workload (see below)

3. From the command-line in the *post-cluster* folder, execute `terraform apply`; copy output

```hcl
workload = {
  sample = {
    external             = true
    limits_cpu           = "100m"
    limits_memory        = "128Mi"
    liveness_probe_path  = "/"
    platform             = "nodejs"
    readiness_probe_path = "/"
    replicas             = 1
    requests_cpu         = "100m"
    requests_memory      = "128Mi"
    resources = []
  }
}
```

## Verify Sample Workload

1. From a browser, navigate to sample.[replace]; replacing with domain name associated with the host zone (from above), e.g., `sample.example.com`

## Setup SSH Connections to AWS CodeCommit

1. [Setup steps for SSH connections to AWS CodeCommit repositories on Linux, macOS, or Unix](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/setting-up-ssh-unixes.html)

**note:** Do not clone repository.

**note:** For Windows use [Setup steps for SSH connections to AWS CodeCommit repositories on Windows](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/setting-up-ssh-windows.html)

## Download and Initialize Sample Image Code

1. Download sample image code; [Starter Kit Image Node.js](https://github.com/larkintuckerllc/starter-kit-image-nodejs/releases/tag/1.0.0)

2. From the downloaded folder, execute `git init`

3. From the downloaded folder, execute `git remote add aws [replace]`; replacing with the *clone_url_ssh* copied from above

**note**: By using the remote *aws*, one can continue to use the *origin* remtoe for their own GIT repository.

## Update the Sample Image Code

1. In the downloaded folder, edit file *index.js*

2. Update the line *res.send('Hello World!');*; replacing the string *Hello World* as you please

3. Save the file

4. From the downloaded folder, execute `git add -A`

5. From the downloaded folder, execute `git commit -m "first commit"`

6. From the download folder, execute `git push aws master`

## Verify Updated Sample Workload

1. From a browser, navigate to sample.[replace]; replacing with domain name associated with the host zone (from above), e.g., `sample.example.com`

**note:** It will take a few minutes for the update to propogate.

## Destroy Sample Workload

1. Edit the file *tf/post-cluster/terraform.tfvars*

2. Replace the *workload* variable with `{}`

3. From the command-line in the *tf/post-cluster* folder, execute `terraform apply`

## Destroy Post-Cluster Infrastructure

1. From the command-line in the *post-cluster* folder, execute `terraform destroy`

**note**: The command will fail with not being able to delete a bucket because it not empty.  Login to the AWS console, navigate to S3, and empty the bucket named *[replace]-codepipeline-[replace]*; replacing with identifier and region name. For example *starter-kit-codepipeline-us-east-1*. Then repeat step 1 delete the bucket.

## Destroy Pre-Cluster Infrastructure

1. From the command-line in the *tf/pre-cluster* folder, execute `terraform destroy`
